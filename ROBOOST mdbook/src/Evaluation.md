# Evaluation

## Group evaluation about the work
Throughout the Roboost project, our team encountered several shifts in tasks and priorities as we adapted to evolving needs and constraints. Initially, the plan was to work with four individual cobots, but we later streamlined this to three, eliminating the Kuka robot since this was a stand-alone project. This adjustment allowed us to focus on delivering higher-quality outcomes with better resource allocation and collaboration. Similarly, our original plan targeted MBO 3 students as the primary audience. However, we expanded this scope to include all studies, ensuring the material's relevance and accessibility to a broader range of learners. This is due the fact that for the material a lot of Python scripts were written. For the lower levels the scirpts will be provided, for the higher educations these scripts can be written by themsels

## Future improvements for your 2nd quartile
Looking ahead to the next quartile, some areas the can be improved are:
- Enhanced Planning and Flexibility: While we adapted well, more thorough initial planning and contingency strategies could help reduce the need for significant mid-project adjustments.
- Clearer Communication: Some shifts in priorities created temporary confusion. Establishing more frequent check-ins and a central system for updates can keep everyone on the same page.
- Feedback Integration: While we expanded our target audience, gathering feedback from students earlier could have helped tailor the content more effectively.

By building on these insights, we aim to refine our processes, improve our collaboration, and deliver an even stronger outcome in the next quartile.
