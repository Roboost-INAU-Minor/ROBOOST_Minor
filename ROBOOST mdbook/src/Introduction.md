Collaborative robots, or cobots, are revolutionizing industrial automation by enabling humans and machines to work side by side. Many companies are eager to join the cobot revolution, investing in these advanced systems to enhance productivity and flexibility. However, a lack of skills and available time often leaves these cobots underutilized, gathering dust instead of delivering value.

This project aims to address that gap by providing students of SMEOT with a practical, hands-on experience in working with cobots. Through this initiative, students will gain the essential knowledge and skills to program and operate cobots effectively, preparing them to bridge the expertise gap in the workforce.

Working with cobots, however, requires a strong focus on safety. Without proper training and precautions, these machines can pose risks to operators. The Roboost Project Group is committed to demonstrating how cobots can be implemented safely and effectively. This document outlines our workflow, detailing the steps taken to design a functional and safe cobot program, from analysis and design to implementation and evaluation.

By sharing this process, we aim to provide future SMEOT students and industry professionals with a robust foundation for working confidently and safely with cobots in diverse industrial settings.
